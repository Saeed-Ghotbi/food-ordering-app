# Food Ordering App

A modern food ordering web application built with `React`, `NextJS`, `TypeScript`, `React-Query` and `Tailwind CSS`. It's very easy to use, we used `react-query` for data fetching.

## Features

- **React**: A powerful library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A versatile React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs without writing CSS.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing for better code quality and development experience.
